# Welcome!

Premier Football Coaching is a fictional football coaching site, based in Manchester, which offers children, from age 9 up to teenagers aged 18, the chance to be coached by top level ex-academy football coaches for a chance to be scouted by professional football clubs. It will attract former academy players as well, hoping to restart their footballing asperations. The name was created to resemble the elite level of english football; The Premier League. 

This site will provide potential players and their parents information about the coaches, provide testimonials from current professional players, times sessions are available and location and the ability to sign up.

## Wireframes

---

To help plan my site I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. Desktop version can be viewed below:

[Desktop-Prices](documents/wireframes/timetable-wireframe.PNG)

[Desktop-signup](documents/wireframes/signup-wireframe.PNG)

Mobile version can be viewed below:

## FEATURES

---

The site consists of 4 main pages; Home/Index page, Coaches, Prices and sessions, Sign-up and additionally a thank you page once the user has submitted the form. 


Each page follows a similar design style for all devices which includes a Navigation bar- containing a logo and navigation links, Internal buttons linking to other pages towards the bottom of each page and a footer for social media links, terms and conditions.

* Navigation bar
  * Identical on all pages for easy navigation
  * Hover effect on links to ensure user is given feedbak and they know where they are positioned on the screen.

* Internal buttons 
  * Feature on all pages same style and size with 'press down' animation once clicked for user feedback.
