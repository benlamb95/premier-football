# Welcome!

Premier Football Coaching is a fictional football coaching site, based in Manchester, which offers children, from age 9 up to teenagers aged 18, the chance to be coached by top level ex-academy football coaches for a chance to be scouted by professional football clubs. It will attract former academy players as well, hoping to restart their footballing asperations. The name was created to resemble the elite level of english football; The Premier League. 

This site will provide potential players and their parents information about the coaches, provide testimonials from current professional players, times sessions are available and location and the ability to sign up.

## Wireframes

## FEATURES

---

The site consists of 4 main pages; Home/Index page, Coaches, Prices and sessions, Sign-up and additionally a thank you page once the user has submitted the form. 


Each page follows a similar design style for all devices which includes a Navigation bar- containing a logo and navigation links, Internal buttons linking to other pages towards the bottom of each page and a footer for social media links, terms and conditions.

* Navigation bar
  * Identical on all pages for easy navigation
  * Hover effect on links to ensure user is given feedbak and they know where they are positioned on the screen.

![Desktop-Navbar](documents/features/navigationbar-desktop.png)

* Smaller device Navigation bar

![Mobile-Navbar](documents/features/navbar-small.png)

* Internal buttons 
  * Feature on all pages except once user on that specific page the button will not appear; same style and size with 'press down' animation once clicked for user feedback.

![Internal-buttons](documents/features/navigationbuttons.png)

* Footer
  * Again consistent in style and ccolour featuring social media links that open in a new browser tab.

![Footer](documents/features/footer.png)

## Home page

* The home page consists of a landing page image which scales in the picture slighlty upon arrival to catch the users attention.
* It also has a rhetorical question to again peak the users attention.

![hero-image](documents/features/heroimage.png)

* Initial text introduces the users to who Premier football coaching are and what they do, tied in with a video for a greater user experience.

* It contains testimonals from current proffessional football players wrapped in a box consistent in shape and colour with hover effect on Nav bar and text on main image.

![players](documents/features/players.png)

## Coaches Page

* Coaches page was designed to be eye catching a resemble a football card e.g. Panini sticker. Again the background colour and shape is the same as elements mentioned previously.
* Cards increase in size slighlty when hovered over

![coaches](documents/features/coaches.png)

* YouTube video features again under the coaches information to provide users and insght of a training session.
* This should encourage users knowledge of how sessions are done and should prompt excitement.

## Prices and sessions Page

* This page is sectioned into 3 main parts, Prices, training sessions and then location.
  * Prices section is just information about how much each session costs, terms of when a session is booked and plyer safety.

* The session section contain an image divided into 5 equal segments all containing information about the day, session type, times and age group.

![sessions](documents/features/sessions.png)

* The location section is a google map with the specified location already input, where customers can interact with the map and take directions.

## Sign up Page

* The sign up form takes president of the full screen intially with an attractive picture behind it
 * Sign up form requires all fields to be filled out to be able to submit

 ![signup](documents/features/form.png)

 * Below the sign up form is contact information inlcuding phone, email and address.

 ## Thank you page

 * This is a very basic page containing a bakground image and overlaying text confirming the form has been submitted.

## COLOURS
  * For my site I used 4 main colours. Gold (#FFD700), Dark Blue (rgba(26, 42, 90, .8), #303159) and white and black.
  * The gold was used to represent quality hence the name Premier but also be eye catching and stand out.
  * The dark blue was a good colour contrast and also a powerful colour. I used both hex and RGBA values as in some cases i required the colour opacity to fade on images.
  * White was present through for white space and black as it contrast's well and is easy to read. 

## Font 
  * The fonts I used within my site was Dosis for headings and signika for main body text, with back up fonts of Sans-serif. These fonts were located from Google fonts and imported oat the top of the CSS file.
