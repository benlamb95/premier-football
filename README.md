# Welcome!

Premier Football Coaching is a fictional football coaching site, based in Manchester, which offers children, from age 9 up to teenagers aged 18, the chance to be coached by top level ex-academy football coaches for a chance to be scouted by professional football clubs. It will attract former academy players as well, hoping to restart their footballing asperations. The name was created to resemble the elite level of english football; The Premier League. 

This site will provide potential players and their parents information about the coaches, provide testimonials from current professional players, times sessions are available and location and the chance to sign up.
