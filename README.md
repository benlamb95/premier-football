# Welcome!

Premier Football Coaching is a fictional football coaching site, based in Manchester, which offers children, from age 9 up to teenagers aged 18, the chance to be coached by top level ex-academy football coaches for a chance to be scouted by professional football clubs. It will attract former academy players as well, hoping to restart their footballing asperations. The name was created to resemble the elite level of english football; The Premier League. 

This site will provide potential players and their parents information about the coaches, provide testimonials from current professional players, times sessions are available and location and the ability to sign up.

## FEATURES

---

The site consists of 4 main pages; Home/Index page, Coaches, Prices and sessions, Sign-up and additionally a thank you page once the user has submitted the form. 


Each page follows a similar design style for all devices which includes a Navigation bar- containing a logo and navigation links, Internal buttons linking to other pages towards the bottom of each page and a footer for social media links, terms and conditions.

* Navigation bar
  * Identical on all pages for easy navigation
  * Hover effect on links to ensure user is given feedbak and they know where they are positioned on the screen.

![Desktop-Navbar](documents/features/navigationbar-desktop.png)

* Smaller device Navigation bar

![Mobile-Navbar](documents/features/navbar-small.png)

* Internal buttons 
  * Feature on all pages except once user on that specific page the button will not appear; same style and size with hover effect turning the background colour slightly darker for user feedback.

![Internal-buttons](documents/features/navigationbuttons.png)

* Footer
  * Again consistent in style and ccolour featuring social media links that open in a new browser tab.

![Footer](documents/features/footer.png)

## Home page

* The home page consists of a landing page image which scales in the picture slighlty upon arrival to catch the users attention.
* It also has a rhetorical question to again peak the users attention.

![hero-image](documents/features/heroimage.png)

* Initial text introduces the users to who Premier football coaching are and what they do, tied in with a video for a greater user experience.

* It contains testimonals from current proffessional football players wrapped in a box consistent in shape and colour with hover effect on Nav bar and text on main image.

![players](documents/features/players.png)

## Coaches Page

* Coaches page was designed to be eye catching a resemble a football card e.g. Panini sticker. Again the background colour and shape is the same as elements mentioned previously.
* Cards increase in size slighlty when hovered over

![coaches](documents/features/coaches.png)

* YouTube video features again under the coaches information to provide users and insght of a training session.
* This should encourage users knowledge of how sessions are done and should prompt excitement.

## Prices and sessions Page

* This page is sectioned into 3 main parts, Prices, training sessions and then location.
  * Prices section is just information about how much each session costs, terms of when a session is booked and plyer safety.

* The session section contain an image divided into 5 equal segments all containing information about the day, session type, times and age group.

![sessions](documents/features/sessions.png)

* The location section is a google map with the specified location already input, where customers can interact with the map and take directions.

## Sign up Page

* The sign up form takes president of the full screen intially with an attractive picture behind it
 * Sign up form requires all fields to be filled out to be able to submit

 ![signup](documents/features/form.png)

 * Below the sign up form is contact information inlcuding phone, email and address.

 ## Thank you page

 * This is a very basic page containing a bakground image and overlaying text confirming the form has been submitted. 

---

## COLOURS
  * For my site I used 4 main colours. Gold (#FFD700), Dark Blue (rgba(26, 42, 90, .8), #303159) and white and black.
  * The gold was used to represent quality hence the name Premier but also be eye catching and stand out.
  * The dark blue was a good colour contrast and also a powerful colour. I used both hex and RGBA values as in some cases i required the colour opacity to fade on images.
  * White was present through for white space and black as it contrast's well and is easy to read. 

## FONT 
  * The fonts I used within my site was Dosis for headings and signika for main body text, with back up fonts of Sans-serif. These fonts were located from Google fonts and imported oat the top of the CSS file.

  * I had used in line styling for i frame which required changing via CSS
  * The use of H1 within my page which i corrected with a h2 and increased font size. 
  * i had used an id for multiple divs so i removed these and instead used class selector.
* Once updates completed by me checked again and no errors found.


* I ran my CSS code through W3C CSS Validator. Initially i recieved some errors. 
  * Due to incorrect spacing between numbers and px values which I corrected.
  * I had used the incorrect flex direction again corrected.

## Solved Bugs and Errors
*  Issue with hero image intially overlapping header. This was fixed by following a YouTube video created by Kevin Powell with the use of clear hack. 
* The navigation bar for smaller devices when opened, would be overlapped by the main image on the index page. To resolve this i had to use Z-index and apply the navigation as the higher element.
* For the coaches page I initially used flex box to align my content however wasnt getting the desired outcome as the items would try to wrap on different lines and wouldnt space how i wanted them.
  * To solve this I researched grid display and found a perfect solutuion for my problem on Stack-over flow.
* I initially used the ID and class selector incorrectly. I removed the ID selector for multiple uses and used class selectors instead.
* On apple Mobile devices the sign up button within my sign up form would show i much lighter colour than what was required. I change my colour back to the gold throughout my site and re styled the hover effect. 
* Once the sign up form was completed and the user would press submit, it wouldnt take them to the thank you page. I realised that method="POST" was the issue after i used method="GET".


## Unsolved Bugs and Errors
* Issue while testing in fire fox would cause my Players and Coaches boxes to flicker the full border rather than the applied border radius style, when the mouse would intially hover over them. This doesnt always happen however.
* The navigation bar for smaller devices also doesnt appear on the thank you page. I tried resolving this by copying the exact code from all my other pages but this didnt work. I then tried creating a test page but again this wouldnt work.
  * To get around this issue I have added a link, to go to index page, within the text infront of my image on that page.


## Linking To User Stories

`As a user, I want be able to understand the information presented and leave me with no further questions`:

* Text, images, and videos all aid to help understand the information presented. Users can find out who PFC is, the coaches and their qualifications, Prices and session times and contact info.

`As a user, I want to understand the main purpose of the site`:

* The main purpose of the site is to attract young footballers and progress them to  a potential football academy. I have used rhetorical questions to capture the users attention, videos thoroughly explain how this can be achieved along with text to support this.

`As a user, I want to be able to navigate through the site easily and provided constant feedback`:

* A navigation bar is present throughout pages, with good contrasting colours and a clear hover effect. Buttons are also included towards the bottom of page so no scroll is required to get to next page. Submit form his linked to a thank you page.

`As a user, I want the site to be attractive to look at`:

* I have used a very eye catching gold colour for header and footer and for certain text elements. I have used large images that scale and player and coaches card with animations.

`As a user, I want to be drawn into signing up for the football training`:

* Throughout each page a sign up button is present with a different colour compared to either coaches or sessions to stand out. Information and videos aim to attract interest from users to sign up.

`As a user, I want view images and see videos of the work that is done at Premier FC`:

* Images are used on all pages and i have included videos on how PFC work and will help them progress and included a training video.

`As a user, I want social media links to be able to keep upto date with the latest information`:

* Social links can be found within the footer of all pages. These open in a new browser so the user doesnt have to use the back button and lose their position on the site.
